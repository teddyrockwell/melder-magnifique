## Lucky Number 7

### What a beautiful day to start testing out posts and begin my journey to 50K month viewers

I can't wait to believe in myself and just go after it.

This is what life is about. Dreams. Going after what you want, while you can.

Carpe Diem is a phrase that we're all familiar with but, do we actually feel the gravity of it? Do we ever truly become aware of how limited our time is and how every moment has some meaning?

This is why failure can't be an option and why you have to go after things endlessly.
