While part of me is hesitant to share this information, I believe everyone deserves to hear the truth:

The Goodwill is a treasure trove for finding great books at low prices.

I'm not going to explain any further, hopefully after hearing or reading about this book, you can put together the pieces of why this is true. Just know that I was able to grab a copy of this book for $2.99.

## Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion

</section>

<section>

### Overview

Overall, this book has ton of value centered around what Dr. Cialdini describes as 'weapons of influence,' which properly encapsulates how effective these strategies & techniques are. He goes in-depth in describing the psychology of persuasion and how they are used to corner almost anybody into compliance, from customers to significant others. This book is virtually a must-read for everybody because we all have been persuaded at one point or another, or have had to do our best to persuade another. Learning about these techniques allows those who are knowledgeable, to flip the script on those looking to exploit them.

## Weapons of Influence

This is the first chapter of the book and functions primarily as a foundation of understanding how devices to achieve compliance in different areas are used all the time, everyday. Want your kid to behave? Want your significant other to handle that undesirable set of chores? Those versed in persuasion might be able to effectively get others to do their bidding, what a powerful weapon indeed.

## Reciprocity

The second chapter is centered around reciprocity and communicating how the "Golden Rule" forces us to expect certain things as social custom. From political parties, to friends, co-workers, to even strangers, a favor "here" usually leads to the unspoken expectation of a favor "there".

### Perceptual Contrast Principle

The salesman knows to sell you that more expensive item first because it's the better option, for him. Y'see, by showing you higher option first, you're more likely to purchase something else that's less expensive because of how it seems much cheaper...in contrast to the first option. What's another $25 when you just spent $125 on something? For the salesman, that's him running away with $150 of your money.

Their sales averages are higher when they show the higher prices first and you might have to walk down on the price of what you're looking to actually spend.

If they showed you the cheap $25 option and it satisfied your needs, they know you'd be out of the door right there after. By showing you that $100 option or even the $50 option, they give you more to consider and might get you to bite the bullet and split the difference. They know this and that's why they do it.

But now you know it too and not only call them out on their tactics, you can use it against them to call them out and have them sweeten the deal for you. Exploit those salesmen looking to exploit you and your wallet!

### Rejection-then-retreat technique

"Hey, can I borrow $50? I know, that's probably a lot."

"I'm sorry, I just wanted to get something to eat but what about $5 so I can at least grab a snack?"

There it is, right there. They open with some absurd ask that they aren't even committed to receiving because they really want significantly less than their original ask.

The thing is, by setting you with what seems like a grand ask, they back off or concede on that ask and move to another position. They "retreat" to that $5 ask because, in contrast to $50, that's a big give-up from what they were expecting. At the same time, since they're not getting what they're originally getting, you feel somewhat obliged to at least leave them with something for their troubles.

## Commitment & Consistency

People who go through a lot to get something, usually value those things more than those who don't go through the same amount of effort.
